People working in public service, from grant writers to top administrators, have to understand, interpret, and write about data.  Some public service jobs, like analyst positions, often require more advanced analysis of data.  The goal of this class is to introduce you to statistics, emphasizing its relevance to current policy issues.  In this class you will read policy and management-related data reports, learn to analyze data, and write about statistical findings in a clear, non-technical manner.  The goal is to provide you with a foundation for working with data in your career.  A few of you may even get excited about analyzing data, and want to further develop your skills in Advanced Quantitative Methods (PAF 9177).

Course Description:  
The first course in a two-course sequence (the second course is PAF 9172) that provides an introduction to research and analytical methods as applied to public policy and management. Students will develop expertise as consumers of research findings and learn methods for designing and conducting research. This first course provides an introduction to data analysis and statistical inference, with an emphasis on policy and management applications. Topics include graphing and numerical summaries, normal distributions, descriptive correlation and regression, basic probability and sampling distributions, confidence intervals, significance tests, chi-square tests, and inference for regression. Students learn these techniques through hands-on work with real data and statistical software.

Course Learning Goals:
•	Understand the purpose of univariate, bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses, including:
•	Measures of central tendency and variability
•	Use of confidence intervals 
•	Understand what type of data is appropriate for each of the following bivariate statistical tests: Chi Square, T-test, Anova, Correlation, and Regression
•	Understand how to interpret and write about univariate, bivariate and multivariate statistical results 
•	Gain a basic understanding of the statistical package SPSS to conduct the types of analyses described above

Remote Teaching Approach
This class will combine both synchronous (real time) and asynchronous (recorded) remote teaching.  The schedule for each week is as follows:

•	Prepare
•	View 1-2 videos of new material
•	Talk With a Classmate: Meet with student in your assigned breakout group to discuss problems or a reading (6:30-7pm Tuesdays or an alternate time)
•	Live Meetings
•	Each Tuesday 7:15- ~8:45pm we will meet on Zoom
•	We will have breakout groups a few times per class that will be set for the first couple of weeks, and then they will broaden so you will meet more students in the class
•	Review 
•	Watch 1 brief video reviewing the week’s material
•	Quiz
•	Complete a brief Blackboard quiz prior to 5pm the day of the next live meeting

During the synchronous meetings, I expect students to show their video.  If you would prefer to use a virtual background, most computers will allow you to upload a photograph to serve as a backdrop.  In the Week 1 pre lecture, I will post a video on how to do this.  Please contact me if you need an exception from this rule.

Synchronous class meetings will be recorded, so they can be viewed if you have a class conflict or you want to review a concept.  They will be posted on an unlisted YouTube site, and a link will be made available on Blackboard.

Grading 
Course grades will be based upon the five components detailed below.  I use the standard Baruch grade cut-offs for graduate instruction in the Baruch faculty handbook (link).
	Grade Components
•	Class Engagement 		10%
•	Weekly Quizzes			10%
•	Data Analysis Assignments	25%
•	Midterm Exam			25%
•	Final Exam			30%

Class Engagement: 10%  
To learn statistics, it is important to be an active class participant.  This requires reading assigned readings prior to class, actively engaging in the class sessions, meeting with classmates to discuss readings and problem sets, and completing assignments.  I expect to hear from each student at least twice per live class session.  If that does not happen, I will begin cold calling on students.

I understand that occasionally there are circumstances which may require that students miss a class.  In such cases, it is the students’ responsibility to learn from a colleague and/or Blackboard what material, announcements, assignments and/or schedule changes were missed.  It is not necessary to contact me, unless the circumstances warrant it.  

Problem Sets/Quizzes: 10%
We will have a brief, weekly online problem set on the material from the prior class as well as earlier material.  Sometimes the problem sets will require use of SPSS.  The problem sets will be available on Blackboard, which calls them tests, the Thursday morning after our class session and will be available until 5pm the day of the next class.  The problem sets are to be done on your own, and we will go over the correct answers in the next class.  The lowest two scores of the semester will be dropped, and will not count towards your problem set grade.

There is a growing evidence base demonstrating that the process of recalling course material through low stakes quizzes substantially helps retention and learning.  For an accessible synthesis of this literature, please see Brown PC, Roediger HL, and McDaniel MA, Make it Stick, Harvard University Press. 2014.  

Data Analysis Assignments: 25%
There will be three data analysis assignments that will require analyzing and presenting data, and writing up the results as a research brief, in a clear, non-technical manner.  The first assignment, worth 5%, will be the first part of the results section of the research brief.  It will require conducting univariate analyses to describe the study sample and key variables, and writing the first part of the results section.  You will be connected with another student in class to do a peer review prior to submitting the assignment.

The second assignment, also worth 5%, will be the second part of the results section.  This assignment will require: 1) revising Assignment 1 based upon individual and group feedback, and 2) conducting bivariate analyses to examine the relationships between the key independent variables and dependent variables, and 3) writing up the results.  Again, there will be a peer review process.

The third assignment, worth 15%, will be a full research brief.  It will require writing a brief introductory section that places the research in a broader context, a methods section, and a discussion section.  You will be expected to revise the first two sections of the results section (Assignment 1 & 2), and conduct multivariate analyses, examining the key independent variables and dependent variables controlling for other potentially related variables, to complete the results section.

Exams 
The midterm (25%) and final (30%) will both be “in-class” exams.  You can have a calculator and the exams are open note.
 
Course Logistics
Flexibility: These are very unusual and challenging times, and I understand that students may need some flexibility at various points in the semester.  Please reach out to me if you need an adjustment with deadlines or additional supports.

Blackboard: All class materials will be available on Blackboard.  For each week of the course, there will be four sections: 
•	Prepare: There will be links to recorded lectures, readings, and other information that should be completed before the live class.
•	Live Class: This will have the link to the Zoom session, and slides for the lecture will be posted by 4pm the day of class.
•	Review: There will be a brief (~15-20 minute) recorded review lecture each week.
•	Quiz: The brief quiz that will be posted by Thursday midday each week, and is due to be completed by 5pm on the day of the next live class.

Zoom:  Please make sure that your name is correct on Zoom.  You can rename yourself, going to Participants, hovering over your name, and clicking on “more”.

During the synchronous meetings, I expect students to show their video.  If you would prefer to use a virtual background, most computers will allow you to upload a photograph to serve as a backdrop.  In the Week 1 pre lecture, I will post a video on how to do this.  Please let me know if you will need an exception from this expectation (via email or the week 1 student information form).

Synchronous class meetings will be recorded, so they can be viewed by students in this class, if someone cannot attend a class or wants to review material.  The videos will be posted on an unlisted YouTube site, and a link will be made available only on the class Blackboard site.  Students who have their video on and speak are consenting to the recording for this purpose.  If you are not willing to consent, please keep your camera off (and please let me know about your concern via email or the week 1 student information form).

Reaching Professor Greene: I will be in the Zoom classroom 15 minutes before class starts, and can answer any questions you have then.  If you have questions at other times, please first look at Blackboard, and if that does not answer the question, reach out to me via email (jessica.greene@baruch.cuny.edu) and we can set up a time for a Zoom meeting.

Course Slides: The PowerPoint slides that I use for synchronous and asynchronous sessions will be posted on Blackboard.  Students often find them useful to have during class, either on a tablet- to write on directly, or to print out (though, there are often many slides).  If the slides are not posted by 4pm on the day of live class, please email me, as it is likely a mistake.  On occasion I will make last minute changes to the slides after they are posted.  

SPSS: During class, I will demonstrate how to use SPSS using the point and click approach, and I will also post online lectures of how to conduct each type of analysis required for class.  For students interested in developing strong data analysis skills, I will post mini online lectures showing how to conduct each statistical test using programming language (or syntax).  If you submit programming as part of the assignments, you will receive extra credit.

Baruch offers students free access to SPSS via the CUNY Virtual Desktop.  To access the software (which will not be on your computer), you will need to install the virtual desktop software (link).  Once you are connected to the Virtual Desktop, which links your computer to another computer, you will be able to open SPSS.  When you run the software, you may not have access to the software or files on your own computer.  Accessing SPSS data files is possible via the Web (Blackboard or OneDrive) or a thumb drive.  It works well on most, but not all computers.

Alternatively, SPSS is also available for purchase to students at reasonable rates.  Examples of websites with student rental pricing: “StudentDiscounts” (link)—you can rent two installations for 12 months for around $60. 

Tutoring: MSPIA provides tutoring services for PAF 9170 students. This is particularly recommended if you are struggling during lectures to understand the material. You will receive information regarding tutoring in a MSPIA email.

Calculator
A basic calculator (or phone) is needed for use in class and for exams.  It should be able to do square roots and square terms, but it does not need more fancy capabilities.   

Microsoft Word
For your assignments you will need to use a feature in Microsoft Word called decimal aligning.  Word and other Microsoft products are available free to Baruch students for up to five devices (link).

Academic Integrity: By participating in this course you fully support Baruch College's policy on Academic Honesty, which states, in part: 
"Academic dishonesty is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Cheating, forgery, plagiarism and collusion in dishonest acts undermine the college's educational mission and the students' personal and intellectual growth. Baruch students are expected to bear individual responsibility for their work, to learn the rules and definitions that underlie the practice of academic integrity, and to uphold its ideals. Ignorance of the rules is not an acceptable excuse for disobeying them. Any student who attempts to compromise or devalue the academic process will be sanctioned."
Sanctions in this class for academic dishonesty may range from a failing grade on the assignment to a failing grade for the entire course. A report of suspected academic dishonesty will be sent to the Office of the Dean of Students. 

Students with Disabilities
Baruch has a commitment to providing reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities. Like so many things this fall, the need for accommodations and the process for arranging them have been altered by COVID-19 and the safety protocols currently in place. Students with disabilities who may need accommodations in order to fully participate in this class should contact Student Disability Services as soon as possible at disability.services@baruch.cuny.edu
