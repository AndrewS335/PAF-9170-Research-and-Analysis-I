# PAF-9170-Research-and-Analysis-I
A summary of my completed assignments for a graduate-level course in research methods/statistics. This class primarily leveraged SPSS for statistical analysis of public policy datasets. 

There are three assignments completed for this course leveraging SPSS and publicly available datasets. Below is a short description of each. 

The first assignment will require conducting univariate analyses describing the sample of analysts in terms of socio-demographics, work setting, and salary.  This type of descriptive analyses is always the starting point for more complex data analysis, and is typically the first table in a research paper.  

The second assignment will focus on bivariate analyses examining whether race/ethnicity is related to salary among public sector analysts, and whether the other demographic and work setting characteristics are associated with salary.  For this assignment, you will also be asked to revise your write up of Assignment 1 based upon feedback.

For the final assignment you will create the full research brief.  It will require conducting multivariate analysis, in which you will examine the relationship between race/ethnicity and salary, controlling for other factors that may be related to both key variables.  The results section of the brief will combine your revised Assignments 1 & 2, as well as the multivariate findings.  To complete the brief, you will add introduction, methods, and discussion sections.
